# Environment Isolation - Backend Investigation Findings

## Date: 2025-10-30
## Status: ✅ Backend Fully Supports Environment Isolation

## Summary
The Control Core backend **already has comprehensive environment support** built into the database schema and API endpoints. All major models have environment fields, and API endpoints accept environment query parameters for filtering.

## Database Schema - Environment Support

### ✅ Policy Model
```python
environment = Column(String, default="sandbox", index=True)  # sandbox, production, both
sandbox_status = Column(String, default="not-promoted")
production_status = Column(String, default="not-promoted")
promoted_from_sandbox = Column(Boolean, default=False, index=True)
promoted_at = Column(DateTime)
promoted_by = Column(String)
folder = Column(String, default="enabled")  # enabled, disabled, drafts
```
**Supports**: Full dual-environment lifecycle with promotion tracking

### ✅ ProtectedResource Model
```python
environment = Column(String, default="sandbox")  # sandbox, production
original_host = Column(String)
original_host_production = Column(String)
```
**Supports**: Separate sandbox and production hosts

### ✅ PEP (Bouncer) Model
```python
environment = Column(String, nullable=False)
```
**Supports**: Required environment field, each bouncer is environment-specific

### ✅ PIPConnection Model
```python
environment = Column(String, default="both", index=True)  # sandbox, production, both
sandbox_endpoint = Column(String)  # Optional separate endpoint for sandbox
production_endpoint = Column(String)  # Optional separate endpoint for production
```
**Supports**: Can be shared across environments or environment-specific

### ✅ DecisionRequest/AuditLog Models
```python
environment = Column(String, default="sandbox", index=True)  # sandbox, production
```
**Supports**: Environment tracking for all authorization decisions and audit logs

## API Endpoints - Environment Filtering Support

### ✅ `/resources` Endpoint
```python
@router.get("/", response_model=List[ProtectedResourceResponse])
async def get_resources(
    skip: int = 0,
    limit: int = 100,
    environment: str = None,  # ✅ Supports environment filtering
    db: Session = Depends(get_db),
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)
):
    """Get all protected resources, optionally filtered by environment."""
```

### ✅ `/peps` Endpoint
```python
@router.get("/", response_model=List[PEPResponse])
async def get_peps(
    skip: int = 0,
    limit: int = 100,
    environment: str = None,  # ✅ Supports environment filtering
    db: Session = Depends(get_db),
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)
):
    """Get all PEPs (The Bouncer instances) with optional environment filtering."""
```

## What This Means

### ✅ **Ready to Implement** (No Backend Changes Needed)
1. Frontend can start using `?environment=sandbox` or `?environment=production` query params
2. All data is already segregated by environment in the database
3. API endpoints already filter by environment when parameter is provided
4. Promotion workflow is already tracked in the database

### 🎯 **Frontend Implementation Required**
1. Update all API calls to include current environment parameter
2. Add environment filtering to settings pages (Resources, PEPs, PIPs, etc.)
3. Update hooks to fetch environment-specific data
4. Show environment badges on all relevant pages

### ⚠️ **Considerations**
1. **PIPs**: Default to "both" environments - UI should allow toggling per-environment endpoints
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing data without environment defaults to "sandbox"
3. **Dashboard Stats**: Need to aggregate or filter by current environment
4. **Audit Logs**: Already track environment, just need UI filtering

## Recommended Implementation Approach

Since backend is fully ready, implement frontend in this order:

1. **Create Environment Badge Component** (reusable across all pages)
2. **Update API Service Layer** (add environment param to all fetch calls)
3. **Update Settings Pages** (Resources, PEPs, PIPs, etc.)
4. **Update Dashboard Stats** (filter by environment)
5. **Update Audit Logs** (add environment filter dropdown)

## Example Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// In any component
const { currentEnvironment } = useEnvironment();

// Fetch environment-specific resources
const { data: resources } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['resources', currentEnvironment],
  queryFn: () => fetch(`/api/resources?environment=${currentEnvironment}`)
});
```

## Conclusion

✅ **Backend is production-ready for full environment isolation**
🎯 **Frontend implementation can proceed immediately**
⚡ **No database migrations or backend changes required**
