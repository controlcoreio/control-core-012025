# SOC2 Compliance Gap Analysis and Implementation Plan

## Current Status vs SOC2 Requirements

### ✅ **Implemented Features**
- Basic RBAC with Auth0 integration
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Audit logging
- Telemetry with anonymization
- Basic security monitoring

### ❌ **Missing SOC2 Features**

#### 1. **User Consent Management (CC9.1)**
- **Gap**: No user consent tracking or management
- **SOC2 Requirement**: Organizations must obtain and manage user consent for data processing
- **Implementation**: Consent management system with granular consent types

#### 2. **Data Minimization (CC9.2)**
- **Gap**: No automated data minimization or privacy controls
- **SOC2 Requirement**: Collect only necessary data and implement privacy controls
- **Implementation**: Data minimization engine with PII detection

#### 3. **Incident Response Automation (CC6.8)**
- **Gap**: No automated incident response system
- **SOC2 Requirement**: Automated detection, classification, and response to security incidents
- **Implementation**: Incident response automation with workflows

#### 4. **Vulnerability Management (CC6.1)**
- **Gap**: No vulnerability scanning or management system
- **SOC2 Requirement**: Regular vulnerability assessments and remediation
- **Implementation**: Automated vulnerability scanning and management

#### 5. **Change Management (CC8.1)**
- **Gap**: No formal change management process
- **SOC2 Requirement**: Controlled change management with approvals
- **Implementation**: Change management workflows with approvals

#### 6. **Data Retention Automation (CC9.2)**
- **Gap**: No automated data retention and deletion
- **SOC2 Requirement**: Automated data lifecycle management
- **Implementation**: Automated data retention and deletion system

#### 7. **OPAL Security Enhancement (CC6.1)**
- **Gap**: OPAL lacks proper authentication and verification
- **SOC2 Requirement**: Secure communication between components
- **Implementation**: Enhanced OPAL security with mTLS and verification

#### 8. **Real-time Compliance Monitoring (CC7.5)**
- **Gap**: No real-time SOC2 compliance monitoring
- **SOC2 Requirement**: Continuous compliance monitoring and reporting
- **Implementation**: Real-time compliance dashboard and alerts

#### 9. **Right to Deletion (CC9.1)**
- **Gap**: No user data deletion capabilities
- **SOC2 Requirement**: Users must be able to request data deletion
- **Implementation**: Data deletion workflows and verification

#### 10. **Privacy Impact Assessment (CC9.2)**
- **Gap**: No privacy impact assessment process
- **SOC2 Requirement**: Regular privacy impact assessments
- **Implementation**: Automated privacy impact assessment tool
