# Control Core Business Admin Console
The Control Core Business Admin Console is a comprehensive Stripe-powered CRM and business operations platform for managing all Control Core customer accounts, subscriptions, and business operations. Control Core is the centralized authorization and compliance platform built for the AI-driven enterprise. It solves the core problem of securing the dynamic, real-time interactions between new AI initiatives and legacy technology. By enforcing business, security, and compliance rules with dynamic context management, Control Core eliminates the need for brittle, custom-coded access logic, turning a major security liability into a strategic advantage. It empowers organizations to innovate faster, reduce operational costs, and mitigate the risk of a breach.
## Overview
The Business Admin Console is completely separate from Control Core infrastructure (bouncer, control plane, demo apps). It serves as a comprehensive business operations hub powered by Stripe:
- **Stripe-Powered CRM**: Complete customer relationship management using Stripe as the engine
- **Product & Pricing Management**: Manage Control Core products, pricing tiers, and catalog
- **Subscription Management**: Handle all subscription lifecycle operations
- **Billing & Invoicing**: Complete billing, invoicing, and payment processing

The UI/UX matches the Control Core Control Plane exactly for consistency.
