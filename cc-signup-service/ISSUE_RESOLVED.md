# Issue Resolved! ✅

## Problem
Changes weren't showing because I was editing the **wrong file**.

## Root Cause
The signup service has **TWO different files**:

1. ❌ `/frontend/src/components/UnifiedBouncerDownload.tsx` - **NOT USED** (I was editing this)
2. ✅ `/frontend/src/pages/DownloadPackagesPage.tsx` - **ACTUALLY USED** (the correct file)

The bouncer types are embedded directly in `DownloadPackagesPage.tsx`, not in a separate component!

## What I Fixed

### In `/frontend/src/pages/DownloadPackagesPage.tsx`:

1. ✅ Added **MCP Bouncer (AI Agents)** as 3rd type with "New" badge
2. ✅ Set **Sidecar Bouncer** as recommended (green badge)
3. ✅ Changed **Reverse Proxy** to NOT recommended
4. ✅ Updated version to **042025** (only option, removed old versions)
5. ✅ Added `Cpu` icon import for MCP Bouncer
6. ✅ Improved descriptions for all bouncer types

## Verification

Build output shows **hash changed**:
- ❌ Old: `index-BmHM1rkm.js`
- ✅ New: `index-DxhhVbHg.js`

Confirmed in new build:
- ✅ "MCP Bouncer" found
- ✅ "042025" found
- ✅ Sidecar marked as recommended

## What You'll See Now

### At http://localhost:8002

**Signup Form (First Page):**
- ✅ Job Title field (instead of duplicate email)
- ✅ Business Email with verification note

**Downloads Page (Bouncers Tab):**
- ✅ **3 bouncer cards** (Sidecar, Reverse Proxy, MCP)
- ✅ **Sidecar Bouncer** with green "Recommended" badge
- ✅ **MCP Bouncer (AI Agents)** with blue "New" badge
- ✅ **Version dropdown**: "v042025 (Latest Stable)" ONLY

## Action Required

**Just refresh your browser** - no hard refresh needed since the filename changed!

```
Simply press: Cmd+R (Mac) or F5 (Windows)
```

Since the JavaScript filename changed (`DxhhVbHg` instead of `BmHM1rkm`), your browser will see it as a completely new file and load it fresh.

## Why This Happened

The signup service has a different architecture than the PAP application:
- **PAP**: Uses separate reusable components
- **Signup Service**: Embeds component logic directly in page files

I assumed they had the same structure, which is why I was editing the wrong file.

## Summary

- ✅ **Correct file identified and updated**
- ✅ **Build completed with new hash**
- ✅ **All changes verified in built file**
- ✅ **Service already running and serving new files**
- 🎯 **Just refresh browser to see changes**

The issue is resolved! 🎉
