# Control Core Development Workflow

## 🏗️ Git Branch Strategy

### Branch Structure

```
main (production-ready baseline)
├── rakesh (principal developer branch)
│   ├── feature/component-name
│   ├── feature/api-enhancement
│   └── feature/ui-improvement
├── developer-name (other developers)
│   ├── feature/their-feature
│   └── bugfix/issue-name
└── release/v1.0.0 (release branches)
```

### Branch Roles

#### **main** - Production Baseline
- **Purpose**: Stable, production-ready code
- **Protection**: Requires PR reviews and CI/CD approval
- **Access**: All developers can create PRs to main
- **Updates**: Only through Pull Requests

#### **rakesh** - Principal Developer Branch
- **Purpose**: Rakesh's primary development branch
- **Access**: Direct push access for Rakesh
- **Integration**: Regular merges from main, frequent pushes to main
- **Features**: All major architectural changes and core features

#### **developer-name** - Individual Developer Branches
- **Purpose**: Isolated development for each team member
- **Access**: Direct push access for respective developer
- **Integration**: Regular merges from main, PRs to main

#### **feature/*** - Feature Branches
- **Purpose**: Specific feature development
- **Access**: Developer who created the branch
- **Integration**: PRs to developer branch or main

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Daily Development Process

#### 1. **Start of Day**
```bash
# Switch to your development branch
git checkout rakesh

# Pull latest changes from main
git pull origin main

# Merge main into your branch (if needed)
git merge main
```

#### 2. **During Development**
```bash
# Create feature branches for specific work
git checkout -b feature/new-component

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new component functionality"

# Push feature branch
git push origin feature/new-component
```

#### 3. **End of Day**
```bash
# Merge feature into your development branch
git checkout rakesh
git merge feature/new-component

# Push your development branch
git push origin rakesh

# Clean up feature branch
git branch -d feature/new-component
```

### Weekly Integration Process

#### **Monday - Sync with Main**
```bash
# Pull latest from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Update your development branch
git checkout rakesh
git merge main
git push origin rakesh
```

#### **Friday - Push to Main**
```bash
# Create PR from rakesh to main
# Review changes
# Merge after approval
```

## 🚀 CI/CD Integration

### Automated Checks

#### **On Push to Any Branch**
- Code linting and formatting
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Security scans

#### **On PR to Main**
- Full test suite
- Build verification
- Deployment preview
- Performance tests

#### **On Merge to Main**
- Production deployment
- Documentation updates
- Release notes generation

### Branch Protection Rules

#### **Main Branch Protection**
- Require pull request reviews (2 reviewers)
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date
- Restrict pushes to main
- Require linear history

#### **Developer Branch Protection**
- Require status checks to pass
- Allow force pushes (for rebasing)
- Allow deletion after merge

## 📝 Commit Message Convention

### Format
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Types
- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks

### Examples
```
feat(cc-pap): add policy template management
fix(cc-bouncer): resolve caching issue in policy evaluation
docs(api): update authentication endpoints documentation
refactor(cc-opal): improve policy synchronization performance
```

## 🔧 Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install required tools
npm install -g @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional
npm install -g husky
```

### Repository Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/rakeshcontrolcore/control-core-012025.git
cd control-core-012025

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up git hooks
npx husky install
npx husky add .husky/commit-msg 'npx --no -- commitlint --edit $1'
```

## 🤝 Collaboration Guidelines

### Code Reviews
- **Required**: All PRs to main must be reviewed
- **Reviewers**: At least 2 team members
- **Timeline**: Reviews within 24 hours
- **Approval**: All reviewers must approve

### Conflict Resolution
- **Merge Conflicts**: Resolve in feature branch
- **Rebase**: Use rebase to keep history clean
- **Communication**: Discuss major conflicts in team chat

### Release Process
1. **Feature Freeze**: Stop new features 1 week before release
2. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing on staging
3. **Release Branch**: Create release branch from main
4. **Deployment**: Deploy to production
5. **Tagging**: Tag release with version number

## 📊 Monitoring and Metrics

### Development Metrics
- **Commit Frequency**: Track development activity
- **Code Coverage**: Maintain >80% test coverage
- **Build Success Rate**: Monitor CI/CD pipeline health
- **Review Time**: Track code review efficiency

### Quality Gates
- **Linting**: All code must pass linting
- **Tests**: All tests must pass
- **Security**: No high-severity vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: No performance regressions

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### **Merge Conflicts**
```bash
# Resolve conflicts
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout rakesh
git merge main
# Resolve conflicts manually
git add .
git commit -m "resolve merge conflicts"
```

#### **Branch Out of Sync**
```bash
# Rebase your branch on main
git checkout rakesh
git rebase main
git push origin rakesh --force-with-lease
```

#### **Lost Commits**
```bash
# Find lost commits
git reflog
# Recover specific commit
git checkout <commit-hash>
git checkout -b recovery-branch
```
