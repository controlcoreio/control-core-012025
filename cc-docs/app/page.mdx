# Control Core Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for Control Core - the centralized authorization and compliance platform built for the AI-driven enterprise.

## What is Control Core?

Control Core is the centralized authorization and compliance platform designed for organizations navigating the complexities of AI adoption, regulatory compliance, and modern security challenges.

### Why Organizations Choose Control Core

**1. Regulatory Compliance Made Simple**

Automatically enforce GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2, PCI-DSS, FINTRAC, and OSFI requirements with policy-as-code. Built-in audit logging and compliance reporting ensure consistency and traceability across your entire infrastructure.

*Example*: Automatically enforce data residency rules for GDPR compliance - policies ensure EU citizen data never leaves approved regions, with automatic audit trails for regulatory reporting.

**2. Prevent Data Leakage to AI Systems**

Control what data AI agents, LLMs, and RAG systems can access with dynamic content filtering and prompt injection protection. Real-time data masking based on user context prevents sensitive information from reaching external AI services.

*Example*: Block PII from being sent to external LLMs while allowing non-sensitive queries - Control Core masks social security numbers, credit cards, and personal data before AI processing, maintaining utility while protecting privacy.

**3. Enforce Business Context Dynamically**

Context-aware policies adapt to user role, location, time, and business state. Connect any data source as a Policy Information Point (PIP) for real-time policy decisions with sub-100ms latency.

*Example*: Allow financial transactions only during business hours from approved locations - policies automatically factor in time zones, user location, transaction amounts, and approval workflows.

**4. Centrally Manage All Permissions**

Single source of truth for authorization across all systems. Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC) eliminates scattered permission logic. Version control and GitOps workflow for policy changes ensure consistency and enable rapid deployment.

*Example*: Update access rules once, enforce everywhere automatically - change a role definition in Control Core, and all systems (APIs, databases, applications) immediately reflect the new permissions without code changes.
