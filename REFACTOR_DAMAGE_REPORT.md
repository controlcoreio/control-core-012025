## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Environment Switching (Frontend)
- [x] Dashboard shows correct widgets per environment
- [x] Dashboard production banner displays
- [x] Policies page hides templates in production
- [x] Wizard blocked in production mode
- [x] Environment badge shows on all settings pages
- [ ] Environment switcher triggers data refresh (needs manual testing)

### ⚠️ Environment Filtering (Backend)
- [ ] **Test PEPs filtered by environment**
- [ ] **Test Resources filtered by environment**
- [ ] **Test Policies filtered by environment**
- [ ] **Test Data Sources filtered by environment**

### ⚠️ GitHub Configuration
- [ ] **Test GitHub connection from /settings/github**
- [ ] **Test folder structure creation (sandbox/production)**
- [ ] **Test auto-sync functionality**
- [ ] **Test webhook configuration**
- [ ] **Test policy sync to correct folders**

### ⚠️ Backend Services (CRITICAL - Not Tested)
- [ ] **Test policy CRUD operations**
- [ ] **Test PEP registration and configuration**
- [ ] **Test GitHub service integration**
- [ ] **Test credential encryption**
- [ ] **Test OPAL integration**
- [ ] **Test database migrations**

### ⚠️ Production Mode Restrictions (Backend)
- [ ] **Verify backend prevents policy creation in production**
- [ ] **Verify backend enforces environment isolation**
- [ ] **Test policy promotion workflow**
- [ ] **Test environment-specific API keys**

### ⚠️ Integration Testing
- [ ] **Full end-to-end policy creation in sandbox**
- [ ] **Full end-to-end policy promotion to production**
- [ ] **GitHub sync for both environments**
- [ ] **PEP deployment and connection**
- [ ] **Resource protection workflow**
- [ ] **Audit log generation**

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Full Backend Testing Session**
   - Run through all major workflows
   - Test environment isolation
   - Verify GitHub integration

2. **Restore Critical Documentation**
   - Review deleted docs from git history
   - Restore PERSISTENCE_GUARANTEE.md
   - Restore PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_SAFETY.md
   - Restore GITHUB_SETTINGS_TEST_GUIDE.md

3. **Code Review**
   - Review the 1300+ lines added to backend services
   - Verify credential encryption implementation
   - Check for any breaking changes in models

4. **Rollback Strategy**
   - Document how to rollback to pre-refactor state if issues found
   - Tag current working state

### Future Prevention

1. **Testing Before Refactoring**
   - Create comprehensive test suite
   - Document all critical features before major refactors
   - Use feature flags for risky changes

2. **Better Git Workflow**
   - Don't commit "revert fixes" that actually break things
   - More descriptive commit messages
   - Smaller, focused commits

3. **Documentation**
   - Don't delete documentation during "cleanup"
   - Move to docs/archived/ if truly obsolete
   - Keep test guides always

## Recovery Status Summary

**Frontend:** ✅ 90% RECOVERED  
**Backend:** ⚠️ UNKNOWN - NEEDS TESTING  
**Documentation:** ❌ 50% LOST  
**Overall Risk:** ⚠️ MEDIUM-HIGH (Backend untested)

---
**Next Steps:** Run comprehensive backend testing before declaring recovery complete.
