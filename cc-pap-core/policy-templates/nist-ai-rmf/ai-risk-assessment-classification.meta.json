  "summary": "NIST AI RMF compliant risk assessment and classification policy for AI systems",
  "detailed_description": "This policy implements the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (RMF) for comprehensive AI system risk assessment and classification. It evaluates AI systems across multiple dimensions including impact on critical infrastructure, human safety, civil rights, and financial systems. The policy calculates a weighted risk score based on impact (40%), likelihood (35%), and exposure (25%) factors, then classifies systems into risk levels (low, medium, high, critical) with corresponding approval requirements.\n\nKey features:\n- Automated risk scoring based on system characteristics\n- Multi-factor risk assessment (impact, likelihood, exposure)\n- Tiered approval workflows based on risk classification\n- Compliance with NIST AI RMF standards\n- Continuous monitoring requirements for high-risk systems",

Auditor requirement: demonstrate model approval process, training data governance, and bias testing before production deployment. Policy enforces: (1) Risk assessment by Chief AI Officer, (2) Validation by independent team showing <2% false positive rate, (3) Monthly bias audits on protected classes, (4) Automated rollback if accuracy drops below 95%.
