  "summary": "OSFI Guideline B-13 Technology and Cyber Risk Management compliance for Canadian financial institutions",
  "detailed_description": "This policy template implements OSFI Guideline B-13 Technology and Cyber Risk Management controls for Canadian financial institutions. It provides comprehensive authorization and governance capabilities mandated by Canada's federal banking regulator for federally regulated financial institutions (FRFIs) including banks, trust companies, and insurance companies.\n\nThe policy enforces critical cyber security controls, third-party technology risk management, incident response requirements, cyber resilience testing, executive oversight, and business continuity planning. It ensures financial institutions maintain robust technology risk management frameworks aligned with OSFI's expectations for operational resilience, cyber security preparedness, and technology governance.\n\nKey capabilities:\n- Real-time enforcement of cyber security controls for critical systems\n- Third-party vendor risk assessment requirements before onboarding\n- Mandatory incident response activation for high-severity events\n- Annual cyber resilience testing validation\n- Executive-level approval for major technology investments\n- Multi-factor authentication for data center access\n- Change management controls for production deployments\n- Business continuity and disaster recovery plan validation\n- Quarterly technology risk reporting to board of directors\n\nThis template is designed for deployment in Control Core's policy engine and can be customized to meet institution-specific requirements while maintaining OSFI B-13 compliance.",

      "scenario": "Royal Bank of Canada secures access to core banking systems processing 18M customer accounts and $1.7T in assets. OSFI examination focuses on: (1) Cyber controls for 15,000 employees accessing critical systems, (2) MFA enforcement for privileged access, (3) Patch management currency for 5,000+ servers, (4) Third-party vendor risk assessments. Policy enforces: MFA required for all core banking access, automated blocking if patches >30 days old, vendor risk assessment completion before contract signing, quarterly cyber metrics to board including penetration test results. OSFI exam result: Strong rating on technology risk management, zero findings on B-13 compliance."
