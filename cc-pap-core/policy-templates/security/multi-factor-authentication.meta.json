  "detailed_description": "This policy template implements Multi Factor Authentication controls for Security. It provides comprehensive authorization and governance capabilities with real-time policy evaluation. \n\nThe policy evaluates 13 different conditions including user attributes, resource properties, and contextual information. Policy decisions are made dynamically based on the current state of the system, user context, and resource characteristics. \n\nKey capabilities:\n- Real-time authorization decisions with sub-millisecond evaluation\n- Comprehensive audit logging for all policy evaluations\n- Dynamic context enrichment from multiple data sources\n- Fine-grained attribute-based access control (ABAC)\n- Support for both allow and deny rules with conflict resolution\n\n\nThis template is designed to be deployed in Control Core's policy engine and can be customized to meet your specific requirements. It follows best practices for policy authoring and includes comprehensive error handling.",

      "scenario": "Financial services firm with 200 external contractors needs zero trust controls for production access. Security team requirements: (1) Contractors never have standing access - must request each time, (2) Access limited to specific IP ranges and time windows, (3) All contractor actions logged and reviewed, (4) Sensitive data masked for contractors. Policy enforces: Time-bound access (max 4 hours), geofencing (only from contractor office IPs), session recording for all production access, automatic data masking for PII/financial data, manager approval required with business justification. Result: Prevented 3 potential data exfiltration attempts, reduced contractor access from permanent to just-in-time."

Security operations needs: (1) Detect unusual database queries (volume, timing, content), (2) Prevent bulk data downloads, (3) Alert on access to sensitive tables outside business hours, (4) Block access to personal connections. Policy implementation: Baseline normal behavior per DBA (avg 500 queries/day), alert on >2,000 queries or >100MB downloads in 1 hour, block queries with >10,000 rows after hours, require SOC approval for production access on weekends, automatic temporary suspension on 3 suspicious activities.

Security requirements: (1) Prevent credential stuffing attacks, (2) Stop data scraping bots, (3) Enforce fair use policies, (4) Protect against DDoS. Policy enforces: Rate limits by partner tier (Tier 1: 1000 req/min, Tier 2: 100 req/min), adaptive throttling during attacks, block suspicious patterns (same User-Agent with 1000+ IPs), circuit breaker after 3 authentication failures, cost attribution for over-limit partners.

Policy enables: Automated isolation of compromised server (disable all network ACLs), block user account associated with initial compromise, alert on any authentication attempts from that account, log all command execution on affected systems, notify CISO and IR team via SMS/email. Containment achieved in 8 minutes, ransomware limited to 1 server instead of spreading to 200+ systems, total damage: $50K vs estimated $5M."

Policy implementation: Centralized policy management integrated with AWS IAM, Azure RBAC, GCP IAM, automated scanning for public storage (S3/Blob/GCS) with auto-remediation, MFA required for console access (enforced via SAML), cross-cloud access reports for audit. Results: Eliminated 150 public buckets, standardized access across clouds, reduced IAM policy inconsistencies from 40% to 5%."
