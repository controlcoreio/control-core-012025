# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Comprehensive answers to common questions about Control Core deployment, configuration, policy management, integrations, and compliance.

## General Questions

### What is Control Core?

Control Core is a centralized authorization and compliance platform built for AI-driven enterprises. It enforces business, security, and compliance rules through policy-based access control (PBAC), enabling organizations to secure interactions between AI initiatives and legacy technology without custom-coded access logic.

### Who should use Control Core?

Control Core is ideal for:
- **Financial Institutions**: Banks, credit unions, fintech companies needing FINTRAC, OSFI, AML compliance
- **Healthcare Organizations**: Hospitals, clinics requiring HIPAA/PHIPA compliance
- **Enterprises**: Organizations with complex authorization requirements
- **AI Companies**: Companies deploying AI agents, LLMs, RAG systems
- **Regulated Industries**: Any industry with compliance requirements (GDPR, SOC 2, PCI-DSS)

### What makes Control Core different from traditional access control?

Traditional access control is hard-coded in applications. Control Core provides:
- **Centralized Policies**: One place to manage all authorization rules
- **Real-Time Enforcement**: Sub-100ms policy evaluation
- **Context-Aware Decisions**: Policies use real-time data from integrated systems
- **No Code Changes**: Apply policies without modifying applications
- **Compliance Automation**: Built-in support for regulatory requirements

### How does Control Core enforce policies without changing application code?

Control Core uses a Policy Enforcement Point (Bouncer) that sits between clients and your application as a reverse proxy. Requests are intercepted, evaluated against policies, and allowed or denied before reaching your application.

### What is the performance impact?

Control Core adds minimal latency:
- **Policy Evaluation**: < 10ms (cached) to 50ms (uncached)
- **Total Request Overhead**: < 100ms on average
- **Caching**: 85-95% cache hit rate in production
- **Scalability**: Handles 10,000+ requests per second per Bouncer instance

## Policy Management Questions

### Do I need to know Rego to use Control Core?

No! Control Core provides:
- **Visual Policy Builder**: No-code policy creation
- **Policy Templates**: Pre-built policies for common scenarios
- **AI-Assisted Policy Creation**: Generate policies from natural language (coming soon)

However, learning Rego enables more advanced policies.

### How do I test policies before deploying to production?

1. Deploy to **Sandbox environment** first
2. Run comprehensive **test cases**
3. Test with **Demo Application**
4. Review **decision logs**
5. Get **peer review** (optional)
6. **Promote to production** when confident

### Can I rollback a policy?

Yes! Every policy change is versioned:
```bash
# In Console: Policies → History → Select version → Rollback
# Via API:
curl -X POST https://api.controlcore.com/api/v1/policies/123/rollback?version=5
```

Rollback is immediate (< 5 seconds to all Bouncers).

### How long does it take for policy changes to apply?

- **Sandbox**: Immediate (< 1 second)
- **Production**: 5-30 seconds (depending on Bouncer fleet size)
- **With caching**: New requests use new policy immediately
- **Cached decisions**: Respect existing cache TTL (typically 1-5 minutes)

### What if a PIP integration fails?

Control Core handles failures gracefully:
- Policies use last-cached data
- Failed integration marked with error status
- Admins notified via configured alerts
- Auto-retry on next sync interval
- Audit log records the failure

### Can I use data from multiple sources in one policy?

Yes! Policies can combine data from multiple PIPs:
```rego
allow if {
    # From Okta
    user := data.policy_data.okta.users[input.user.id]
    
    # From Workday
    employee := data.policy_data.workday.employees[input.user.id]
    
    # From Database

## Troubleshooting Questions

### Why is my Bouncer not connecting to Control Plane?

Check:
```bash
# 1. Network connectivity
curl https://your-tenant.controlplane.controlcore.io/health

# 2. API key correct
echo $API_KEY

# 3. Firewall allows outbound HTTPS
# 4. Check Bouncer logs
docker-compose logs bouncer | grep -i "control plane"
```

### Why are policies not syncing?

Check:
```bash
# 1. OPAL server status
curl http://localhost:7000/health

# 2. Bouncer OPAL connection
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/opal/status

# 3. Force sync
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/opal/sync

# 4. Check OPAL logs
docker-compose logs opal
```

### Why is policy evaluation slow?

Common causes:
- Policy too complex (simplify)
- Cache disabled (enable caching)
- No indexes on PIP data (add indexes)
- Too many policies (consolidate)
- Database slow (optimize queries)

### How do I debug a policy?

1. **Use decision logs**: See actual input/output
2. **Add debug output**: Include debug variables in policy
3. **Test in OPA Playground**: Isolate policy logic
4. **Use OPA CLI**: `opa eval` for testing
5. **Check data availability**: Ensure PIP data synced

### Service won't start after update

```bash
# Check for database migrations
docker-compose exec api alembic current
docker-compose exec api alembic upgrade head

# Check for config changes
diff .env.old .env

# Check logs for errors
docker-compose logs | grep ERROR

# Rollback if needed
docker-compose down
# Restore backup
docker-compose up -d
```

cd cc-demoapp
./infra/start-dev.sh  # Automatically resets weekly

# Or manually
cd cc-demoapp-api
python init_db.py --reset
```

## Best Practices Questions

### What are Control Core best practices?

**Policy Design**:
- Default deny (fail secure)
- Principle of least privilege
- Keep policies simple
- Use helper functions
- Comprehensive testing

**Operations**:
- Test in sandbox first
- Monitor decision logs
- Review policies regularly
- Keep policies in Git
- Document policy changes

**Security**:
- Use MFA for admins
- Rotate API keys quarterly
- Monitor audit logs
- Keep systems updated
- Follow security guide

### How often should I review policies?

**Recommended**:
- **Active policies**: Monthly
- **Compliance policies**: Quarterly (or per regulation)
- **User access**: Quarterly access certification
- **Integration configs**: Monthly
- **Security settings**: Monthly

### Should I use one policy or many?

**Use multiple focused policies**:
- Easier to test
- Easier to debug
- Easier to maintain
- Easier to understand
- Better performance (early exit)

Avoid "mega-policies" that do everything.

### How do I organize policies?

**Recommended structure**:
```
policies/
├── authentication/
│   └── api-key-auth.rego
├── authorization/
│   ├── rbac-basic.rego
│   └── department-access.rego
├── compliance/
│   ├── fintrac-lctr.rego
│   ├── osfi-segregation.rego
│   └── hipaa-minimum-necessary.rego
├── ai-security/
│   ├── prompt-filter.rego
│   └── content-sanitize.rego
└── tests/
    └── *_test.rego
```

### When should I use PIP integrations?

Use PIPs when:
- Policies need real-time user status
- Authorization depends on external data
- Compliance requires current information
- User attributes change frequently
- Resource metadata drives decisions

Don't use PIPs for:
- Static configuration
- Simple role checks (unless roles change frequently)
- Data that never changes
