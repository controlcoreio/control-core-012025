# Control Core Policy Administration Point (PAP)
The Control Core Policy Administration Point (PAP) is the web-based interface for managing authorization policies in the Control Core platform. Control Core is the centralized authorization and compliance platform built for the AI-driven enterprise. It solves the core problem of securing the dynamic, real-time interactions between new AI initiatives and legacy technology. By enforcing business, security, and compliance rules with dynamic context management, Control Core eliminates the need for brittle, custom-coded access logic, turning a major security liability into a strategic advantage. It empowers organizations to innovate faster, reduce operational costs, and mitigate the risk of a breach.
