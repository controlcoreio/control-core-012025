  "summary": "FINTRAC High-Risk Jurisdiction monitoring and enhanced due diligence for international transactions",
  "detailed_description": "This policy template enforces FINTRAC requirements for monitoring transactions involving high-risk and non-cooperative jurisdictions identified by FATF. Financial institutions must apply enhanced due diligence measures when dealing with individuals or entities from countries with strategic AML/ATF deficiencies. The policy includes enhanced scrutiny for high-risk jurisdictions, prohibition of transactions with FATF blacklist countries, mandatory sanctions screening, PEP transaction approval, and high-risk payment corridor monitoring. Ensures compliance with Canada's Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA) and international AML standards.",

    {
      "title": "RBC: Enhanced Due Diligence for High-Risk Country Wire Transfers",
      "description": "Deploy fintrac-high-risk-jurisdiction for international payment screening",
      "scenario": "RBC processes 50,000 international wire transfers daily with 5% involving FATF high-risk jurisdictions (Iran, Myanmar, Pakistan, etc.). FINTRAC requirement: Enhanced due diligence for these jurisdictions including purpose of transaction, source of funds, expected transaction patterns. Policy enforces: Automated flagging of transfers to/from high-risk countries, compliance officer review required (cannot auto-process), source of funds documentation mandatory, enhanced monitoring for 12 months after first transaction. 2024 statistics: 2,500 daily transactions flagged (5%), 90% approved after review (legitimate trade, remittances), 10% blocked (insufficient due diligence, suspicious), average review time 45 minutes (SLA: 4 hours). Customer impact: Delays explained ('enhanced verification for your protection'), satisfaction 78% (vs. 92% for standard transfers). FINTRAC examination: Strong high-risk jurisdiction controls, commended for risk-based approach balancing AML effectiveness with customer service."

      "title": "TD: FATF Blacklist Country Transaction Prohibition",
      "description": "Implement fintrac-high-risk-jurisdiction for sanctioned country blocking",
      "scenario": "TD maintains prohibition on transactions with FATF blacklist countries (North Korea, Iran - as of 2024). Policy absolute block: Any payment to/from blacklisted country automatically rejected, no exceptions (even humanitarian - requires OFAC/GAC license), customer notified with explanation, transaction reported to FINTRAC as attempted transaction with prohibited jurisdiction. 2024 incidents: 47 attempted transactions to Iran (mostly Iranian-Canadian diaspora sending remittances to family), all blocked automatically within 1 second, customers directed to licensed money service businesses specializing in Iran transfers (legal under specific conditions), 3 escalated to FINTRAC as potential sanctions evasion attempts (amounts >$50K). Compliance: 100% blacklist transaction blocking, zero violations, TD avoided potential $10M+ penalties for sanctions breaches. FINTRAC/OSFI feedback: Robust sanctions compliance with appropriate customer communication."

      "title": "Scotiabank: PEP (Politically Exposed Person) Transaction Monitoring",
      "description": "Use fintrac-high-risk-jurisdiction for PEP enhanced monitoring",
      "scenario": "Scotiabank has 15,000 PEP clients globally (foreign PEPs: diplomats, politicians; domestic PEPs: Canadian mayors, MPs, senior bureaucrats; HIOs: family members of PEPs). FINTRAC requirement: Enhanced monitoring for all PEP transactions, senior management approval for transactions >$10,000, ongoing monitoring for unusual patterns. Policy enforces: PEP flag in CRM triggers enhanced transaction review, transactions >$10,000 require branch manager approval (cannot be auto-processed), source of wealth documentation reviewed annually, transaction patterns monitored (sudden large deposits, transfers to high-risk jurisdictions). 2024 PEP monitoring: 15,000 PEP clients generated 250,000 transactions, 12,000 required manual review (>$10K threshold), 150 flagged as unusual (investigated, 142 legitimate, 8 STRs filed). STR examples: Foreign PEP with large cash deposits inconsistent with income, domestic PEP with transfers to offshore accounts, HIO receiving funds from foreign PEP's known associates. Regulatory: Zero missed PEP transactions, comprehensive monitoring program, FINTRAC rated as 'strong' PEP risk management."

      "title": "BMO: Remittance Corridor Risk Assessment",
      "description": "Deploy fintrac-high-risk-jurisdiction for remittance service risk management",
      "scenario": "BMO provides remittance services to newcomers sending money to home countries (top corridors: India $500M/year, Philippines $300M, China $250M, Nigeria $80M). High-risk corridor: Nigeria flagged by FATF for AML deficiencies. Policy approach: India/Philippines/China: standard processing (source of funds verified at account opening, transaction monitoring automated), Nigeria: enhanced measures (source of funds re-verified for each transaction >$5,000, purpose documented, receiving party identified, Nigerian bank verified as legitimate). Implementation: 2024 Nigeria remittances: 12,000 transactions totaling $80M, 3,500 required manual review (>$5,000), 45 blocked (unable to verify receiving party, suspicious patterns), average processing time 6 hours for enhanced review (vs. 1 hour for standard corridors). Customer communication: Explanation of FATF high-risk designation, alternative providers for urgent transfers, removed from high-risk list monitoring (Nigeria exited FATF grey list Oct 2024). FINTRAC: Appropriate risk-based approach for high-risk corridor, good customer communication."

      "scenario": "Desjardins screens all international payments (30,000/day) against sanctions lists: OFSI (Canada), OFAC (USA - voluntary for Canadian banks but best practice), UN, EU. Policy enforces: Real-time screening against consolidated sanctions list (updated daily), 100% match requires transaction block + compliance review, fuzzy match (>80% name similarity) flags for review, screening includes individuals (SDN list), entities, vessels, addresses, Bitcoin addresses (OFAC Specially Designated Digital Currency Addresses). Technology: Sanctions screening vendor (Dow Jones, ComplyAdvantage) API integration, <200ms screening latency (inline during payment processing), false positive rate 0.3% (high accuracy from screening vendor ML). 2024 results: 30,000 payments/day Ã— 365 days = 10.9M screenings, 45 true positives (actual sanctions matches - blocked), 32,000 false positives (reviewed and cleared within 4 hours average), zero sanctions violations, zero OFAC penalties. FINTRAC/OSFI: Comprehensive sanctions program exceeding Canadian requirements (OFAC screening voluntary but demonstrates strong risk culture)."

Scenarios: (1) Canadian citizen living in Pakistan (high-risk) opening investment account, (2) Permanent resident from Iran (blacklist) attempting to fund account, (3) Established client making wire transfer to Myanmar (high-risk). Policy enforces: Enhanced due diligence for clients with ties to high-risk jurisdictions (passport country, residential address, source of funds origin), prohibition on clients with current residence in blacklist countries (Iran, North Korea), ongoing monitoring of wire transfers to high-risk jurisdictions, quarterly review of all high-risk jurisdiction clients. Application: Canadian citizen in Pakistan: Account approved with enhanced KYC (proof of income from Canadian employer, purpose: retirement savings), Enhanced monitoring: quarterly review (no issues). Iranian permanent resident in Canada: Account approved (lives in Toronto, Canadian source of income, no current Iran ties). Wire to Myanmar: Flagged for review, determined to be family support (legitimate), approved with documentation. Compliance: Risk-based approach balances FINTRAC requirements with Charter rights (can't discriminate based on country of origin), focus on current residence and transaction patterns. FINTRAC/IIROC: Acceptable risk-based framework with appropriate safeguards."
