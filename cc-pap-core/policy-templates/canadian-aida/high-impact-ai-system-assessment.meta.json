      "scenario": "Global Bank deploys an AI fraud detection model processing 10M daily transactions. Auditor requirement: demonstrate model approval process, training data governance, and bias testing before production deployment. Policy enforces: (1) Risk assessment by Chief AI Officer, (2) Validation by independent team showing <2% false positive rate, (3) Monthly bias audits on protected classes, (4) Automated rollback if accuracy drops below 95%. Compliance: Federal Reserve SR 11-7 (Model Risk Management)."

      "scenario": "Hospital network implements AI radiology assistant analyzing 5,000 X-rays daily. Auditor verification needed: (1) All 47 radiologists have signed AI use agreements, (2) System logs every AI recommendation with radiologist override capability, (3) PHI access restricted to treating physicians only, (4) AI outputs reviewed by second physician for high-stakes diagnoses. Policy blocks: AI access outside treating relationship, automated AI decisions without physician review. HIPAA audit trail maintained for 6 years."

State regulator audit focuses on: (1) Proving AI doesn't discriminate on race, gender (protected classes), (2) Demonstrating explainability for all denials, (3) Human review for borderline cases. Policy requires: Bias testing quarterly across 50+ demographic segments, explainability scores >0.7, senior underwriter review when AI confidence <85%. Result: Zero discrimination findings in regulatory exam, 23% faster application processing."
