  "summary": "AI Decision Transparency Policy Ensures AI decisions are transparent and explainable Default allow with transparency requirements",
  "detailed_description": "This policy template implements Ai Decision Transparency controls for Ai Governance. It provides comprehensive authorization and governance capabilities with real-time policy evaluation. \n\nThe policy evaluates 6 different conditions including user attributes, resource properties, and contextual information. Policy decisions are made dynamically based on the current state of the system, user context, and resource characteristics. \n\nKey capabilities:\n- Real-time authorization decisions with sub-millisecond evaluation\n- Comprehensive audit logging for all policy evaluations\n- Dynamic context enrichment from multiple data sources\n- Fine-grained attribute-based access control (ABAC)\n- Support for both allow and deny rules with conflict resolution\n\n\nThis template is designed to be deployed in Control Core's policy engine and can be customized to meet your specific requirements. It follows best practices for policy authoring and includes comprehensive error handling.",
