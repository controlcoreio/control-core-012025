## Changes to `/downloads` Page

4. ✅ **Updated info box** - Changed from listing individual services (cc-demoapp, cc-demoapp-api, cc-demoapp-policies-repo) to describing it as "a single unified application container that includes all necessary components (frontend, backend, and sample policies)"

### Button Icon Alignment Fixes
Fixed visual issues with button icons not aligning properly at line breaks by:
- ✅ Added `inline-flex items-center` classes to all buttons in "Next Steps After Download" section
- ✅ Added `flex-shrink-0` to icons to prevent them from shrinking
- ✅ Wrapped button text in `whitespace-nowrap` spans to keep text together
- ✅ Applied fixes to all 5 buttons in the section:
  1. Deployment Guide button
  2. Configuration Guide button
  3. Control Plane URL button
  4. Troubleshooting Guide button
  5. Contact Support button

## Testing

The service has been rebuilt and restarted on port 8002:
- ✅ Service health check: http://localhost:8002/health
- ✅ Frontend: http://localhost:8002
- ✅ Plans page: http://localhost:8002/plans
- ✅ Downloads page: http://localhost:8002/downloads

## Technical Details

- Frontend built using Vite
- Build output: `../app/static`
- Build completed successfully in 1.22s
- Service restarted and verified healthy

## Notes for Future Development

When deploying the Demo App for customers:
- The three services (cc-demoapp, cc-demoapp-api, cc-demoapp-policies-repo) should be packaged as a single unified container
- Helm charts and Docker Compose files should bundle all three services together
- This currently simulates local dev server deployment (not AWS)
